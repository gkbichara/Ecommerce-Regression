# Ecommerce-Regression

## Objective
The goal of this project is to explore and apply regression techniques to predict **Yearly Amount Spent** by customers of an e-commerce website. The project was done to practice and understand the use of linear regression models. The insights from this model can help a company decide whether to focus on improving their mobile app experience or their website to drive more customer spending.

## Data
In this project, I worked with a dataset that includes information about e-commerce customers. The data contains the following key features:
- **Avg. Session Length**: Average session time for in-store advice.
- **Time on App**: Average time a customer spends on the mobile app in minutes.
- **Time on Website**: Average time a customer spends on the website in minutes.
- **Length of Membership**: Number of years the customer has been a member of the platform.
- **Yearly Amount Spent**: Total amount the customer spent in a year.

This project is for educational purposes, and the data is assumed to be fictional.
